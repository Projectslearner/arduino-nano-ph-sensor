# pH Sensor

#### Project Overview

The pH Sensor project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano to interface with a pH sensor. This project reads pH values from the sensor and prints them to the serial monitor. The pH sensor provides an analog voltage output corresponding to the pH level of the solution it is immersed in. 

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **pH Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**
4. **pH Buffer Solutions (pH 4.0 and pH 7.0)**
5. **pH Probe Storage Solution (KCl Solution)**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect pH Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the analog output of the pH sensor to pin A0 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure proper power and ground connections for the pH sensor.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the pH sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Calibration (Optional):**
   - Calibrate the pH sensor using buffer solutions (pH 4.0 and pH 7.0) and follow the manufacturer's instructions.

3. **Power Supply:**
   - Ensure the power supply connected to the pH sensor is appropriate for its voltage requirements.

4. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

5. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - The serial monitor will display pH values read from the sensor periodically.

#### Applications

- **Aquarium Monitoring:** Monitor pH levels in aquarium water.
- **Hydroponics:** Monitor pH levels in hydroponic systems.
- **Water Quality Monitoring:** Measure pH in water bodies for environmental monitoring.

#### Notes

- Adjust the conversion formula in the code based on the specifications of your pH sensor.
- Ensure proper calibration of the pH sensor for accurate readings.
- Handle the pH probe carefully and store it in the provided storage solution when not in use to maintain its longevity.
